# meal-prep
This is the first API I made while practising with third-party api's. 
It allows you to create/generate a meal plan and add the ingredients of those meals to a shopping list.
I also added Authentication on a basic level.
All and all, I had a great time figuring out how API's work.

-------------------do better next time------------
My code is not well organised or even well commented.
I need to work a bit more on making my code a more readable and understandable.
Only use information that is needed, think about the application's architecture before coding.
